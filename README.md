# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## Description
This C program implements a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the user competes against the computer. The game prompts the user to choose between stone, paper, or scissor and generates a random choice for the computer. After each round, the winner is determined based on the classic rules of the game.

## How to Use
1. Compile the program using a C compiler such as GCC.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to make your choice (1 for stone, 2 for paper, 3 for scissor).
4. Enter a random number between 850 to 899 as prompted to generate the computer's choice.
5. The program will display the result of the round.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 for the desired number of rounds (default is 3).
7. After all rounds are completed, the program will announce the winner of the series based on the number of wins.
